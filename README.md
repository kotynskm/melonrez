# Melon Reservation

## <img src="/static/img/melon.png">

# Project Overview

This is a reservation scheduler created as part of a mock takehome assignment given by Hackbright Academy's accelerated software engineering program.

## Technologies

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
**Frameworks & Libraries:** Flask, Bootstrap, Jinja

## Features

- Melon reservation allows a user to login with their email and view reservations for melon tasting appointments. Melon reservations can be searched for by date, selected by the user, and added to their schedule which is viewable on a calendar implemented with FullCalendar.io.

- On the users homepage, currently scheduled reservations will be displayed or a message that there are no current reservations if none are scheduled yet. From the homepage the user can also select to schedule a new reservation, or view their current reservations on the calendar.

- I used a seed file for this project to learn how to add test data to the database for testing purposes.
